This is where I stopped working on this project. The last thing I did was read a HEX dump from an eeprom before and after a print job was done where material was printed from the spool. Those are the 78% and 74% HEX dumps.

When viewing the dumps it appears that only difference in data is on the eeprom's Scratchpad at location A0. Everything else was the same which was very confusing to me. I would have thought some area in the memory, not just
the scratchpad, would have been updated after the print completed to reflect the new amount of material remaining on the spool. 

My theory is that the updated area of the Scratchpad reflects the last time the eeprom was accessed. I don't know for sure about this though. 

It seems like there is some kind of encryption obscuring the data read from the eeprom. I can't figure out how it works though. There are other open source programs to reprogram older print model eeproms, so I wonder
if the de-encryption scheme of those programs would work here.
